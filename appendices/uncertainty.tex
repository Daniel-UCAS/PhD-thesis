For each set of experimental measurements, uncertainty was estimated from both
systematic and random errors. Random error was computed on a
per-rotor-revolution basis and systematic errors were estimated from the sensor
calibrations or datasheets. Computation and combination of both error sources
and their propagation into derived quantities, followed Coleman and Steele
\cite{ColemanSteele}, which is summarized below.

An expanded uncertainty interval with 95\% confidence
\begin{equation}
    U_{95} = t_{95} u_c,
\end{equation}
was computed for mean power coefficient $C_P$, mean rotor drag coefficient
$C_D$, and mean wake velocities, where $t_{95}$ is the value from the Student
$t$-distribution for a 95\% confidence interval and $u_c$ is the combined
standard uncertainty, which is given by
\begin{equation}
    u_X^2 = s_{\bar{X}}^2 + b_X^2,
\end{equation}
where $s_{\bar{X}} = s_X/\sqrt{N}$ is the sample standard deviation of the mean
per turbine revolution, the total of which is $N$. The systematic uncertainty
$b_X$ is computed as
\begin{equation}
    b_{X}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^J \left( \frac{\partial X}{\partial x_i} \right)^2
    b_{x_i}^2,
\end{equation}
where $x_i$ is a primitive quantity used to calculate $X$ (e.g., $T$, $\omega$,
and $U_\infty$ for calculating $C_P$), and $b_{x_i}$ is the primitive quantity's
systematic uncertainty, estimated as half the value listed on the sensor
manufacturer's documentation. Values for each of the sensors are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:sensors}.

Selecting the Student $t$-statistic $t_{95}$ requires an estimate for the number
of degrees of freedom $\nu_X$, which was obtained using the Welch--Satterthwaite
formula \cite{ColemanSteele}:
\begin{equation}
    \nu_X = \frac{\left(s_X^2 + \sum_{k=1}^M b_k^2 \right)^2} {s_X^4/\nu_{s_X} +
    \sum_{k=1}^M b_k^4/\nu_{b_k}},
\end{equation}
where $\nu_{s_X}$ is the number of degrees of freedom associated with $s_X$ and
$\nu_{b_k}$ is the number of degrees of freedom associated with $b_k$.
$\nu_{s_X}$ is assumed to be $(N-1)$. $\nu_{b_k}$ was estimated as
\begin{equation}
    \nu_{b_k} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\Delta b_k}{b_k} \right)^{-2},
\end{equation}
where the quantity in parentheses is the relative uncertainty of $b_k$, which
was assumed to be 0.25.
