\chapter{Dataset availability and usage}
\doublespace

Three open experimental datasets were produced from the work described in
Chapters~\ref{chap:RVAT-baseline}, \ref{chap:Re-dep}, and \ref{chap:RM2}. These
datasets are based around Git version control repositories, which include
histories of all changes made to configuration files, documentation, processed
or derived data, and code used to process and visualize the data. At the time of
writing, these are primarily distributed via the Git repository hosting site
GitHub.com. Specific releases or snapshots of the repositories have been
archived via Figshare.com, which provides digital object identifiers (DOIs). The
Figshare archives thereby provide persistent links, which are cited in the
publications where the data was used. Note that presently, prospective users are
pointed to the repositories on GitHub to ensure they obtain the most recent
version, and may take advantage of some of GitHub's collaboration features,
e.g., issues, wikis, and pull requests.

This appendix contains instructions for using the RM2 tow tank dataset, though
instructions for the UNH-RVAT baseline and UNH-RVAT Reynolds number dependence
datasets are similar. The documentation below was automatically generated from
the RM2 tow tank experiment's wiki on GitHub.
