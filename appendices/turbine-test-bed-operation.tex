\chapter{Turbine test bed operation procedures}
\doublespace

This appendix contains instructions for operating the turbine test bed system as
of its latest iteration, which was used to perform the RM2 experiments described
in Chapter~\ref{chap:RM2}. Note that any links or URLs used here are valid at
the time of this writing, but are subject to change.


\section{Software setup}

A custom Python desktop application, TurbineDAQ, was developed to operate and
automate the turbine test bed systems. Its operation is described below. Note
that this software has not been tested and debugged to ``consumer'' standards,
so it is highly recommended its source code, presently available from
\url{https://github.com/petebachant/TurbineDAQ}, be inspected and understood by
prospective users.
