In this chapter the turbulence models used throughout this work are detailed.

Three eddy viscosity RANS and one LES model was used. The RANS equations with
the eddy viscosity formulation are

\section{Spalart--Allmaras}

The Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model is defined by the transport of a 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{D} \tilde{\nu}}{\mathrm{D} t}
= c_{b1} \tilde{S} \tilde{\nu}
+ \frac{1}{\sigma} 
\left[ 
\nabla \cdot \left( (\nu + \tilde{\nu}) \nabla \tilde{\nu} \right)
+ c_{b2} (\nabla \tilde{\nu})^2
\right]
- c_{w1} f_w \left[ \frac{\tilde{\nu}}{d} \right]^2,
\label{eq:SA}
\end{equation}

The SA turbulent viscosity is defined as $\nu_t = f_{v1} \tilde{\nu}$.
