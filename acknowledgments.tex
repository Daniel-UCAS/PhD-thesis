    First and foremost, thanks to my research advisor and mentor Martin Wosnik,
    without whose (in my opinion, far-fetched) confidence and unwaivering
    support none of this work would have been possible.
    
    Thanks to my committee---professors Baldwin, Foster, Lippmann, Polagye, and
    Swift---for their expertise and guidance.
    
    Thanks to Ashley for putting up with my tunnel vision.
    
    Thanks to my parents for giving me a place to be creative growing up, and
    Tom and Gramps for helping out the with tow tank.
    
    Thanks to Paul Lavoie for many words of wisdom, and allowing plenty of
    ``third shift'' time in the machine shop.
    
    Thanks to the US Department of Energy and Senator J. Shaheen for funding to
    build the experimental setup, from the National Science Foundation (award
    1150797), and to Sandia National Labs.
