    First and foremost, thanks to my research advisor and mentor Martin Wosnik,
    without whose (in my opinion, far-fetched) confidence and unwaivering
    support none of this work would have been possible.

    Thanks to my committee---professors Baldwin, Foster, Lippmann, Polagye, and
    Swift---for their expertise and guidance.

    Thanks to Ashley for trying to ensure I never worked too hard, and for
    understanding when I may have.

    Thanks to my parents for giving me a place to be creative growing up, and
    Tom and Gramps for helping out the with tow tank.

    Thanks to Paul Lavoie for many words of wisdom, and allowing plenty of
    ``third shift'' time in the machine shop.

    Thanks to all the open-source software projects, developers, and communities
    for sharing their skills and support: Python, Anaconda, NumPy, Matplotlib,
    Pandas, OpenFOAM, Linux, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Git, NREL (SOWFA), and more!

    Thanks to the US Department of Energy and Senator Jeanne Shaheen for funding
    to build the experimental setup, from Dr. Geoffrey A. Prentice and the
    National Science Foundation (award 1150797), and to Dr. Vincent S. Neary and
    Sandia National Labs.
