\chapter{Baseline experimental characterization of a high solidity cross-flow
turbine}

For the higher solidity turbine---the UNH-RVAT---the performance and near-wake
were measured in an initial experiment. The Reynolds number dependence,
described in Chapter~\ref{chap:Re-dep}, was observed in a separate experiment.

\section{Turbine model}

A primary goal for the UNH-RVAT was geometric simplicity, for the sake of
replication in numerical models. The turbine was model constructed from straight
14 cm chord length NACA 0020 extrusions, used for both the blades and struts.
Blades were mounted at mid-chord and mid-span, having a length of 1 m and placed
at 1 m diameter.
