\chapter{Developing an actuator line model for cross-flow turbines}

After getting a sense for how two different turbines perform, and how they
affect the flow in which they are placed, the goal is to now develop a way to
predict these effects without resorting to blade-resolved Navier--Stokes CFD.

The ultimate goal of the actuator line model is to drive down the computational
costs of simulating turbines by negating the need for complicated meshing, and
the subsequent boundary layer resolution.
