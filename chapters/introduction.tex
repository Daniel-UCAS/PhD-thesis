\section{General}
\par \indent
There is recent interest in \emph{in-situ} testing of sediments using tethered, free fall probes (\citet{stoll99}, \citet{aubeny06} and \citet{stoll06}). Advances in probe technology and the need for robust methods and models to assess the physical properties of sediments has renewed research focused on the ability of such probes to deliver important geotechnical properties of sediments. This study was supported in part by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology \emph{(CICEET)} and the Center for Ocean Engineering at the University of New Hampshire (UNH).
