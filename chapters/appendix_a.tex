\chapter*{Appendix A: Sharing research outputs}

It is unknown how many experimental campaigns have been redundant due to lack of
openness in the research process. While one may argue this is good for the
repeatability of research, it can lead to ``reinvention of the wheel,'' whose
inefficiency is especially important in this age of diminishing research
funding. It was therefore a secondary goal of all the work performed herein was
to share the products in an open and useful manner.
