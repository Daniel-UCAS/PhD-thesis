\section{Comparing cost with physical modeling}


\section{Conclusions}

2-D blade-resolved RANS simulations have been shown to be a poor predictor of
turbine performance.

3-D blade-resolved RANS simulations have been shown to be a fair predictor of
turbine performance and wake characteristics, though the computational cost is
too expensive to be used for engineering work, especially considering the
uncertainty involved compared with physical model studies.
