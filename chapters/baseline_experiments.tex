\chapter{Baseline experimental characterization two model cross-flow turbines}

Two turbines were designed and built with similar scaling, but disparate
solidities, to provide baseline datasets to guide and validate the numerical
models developed later.

For the higher solidity turbine---the UNH-RVAT---the performance and near-wake
were measured in an initial experiment. The Reynolds number dependence,
described in Chapter~\ref{chap:Re-dep}, was observed in a separate experiment.

For the low solidity RM2, the performance was characterized at multiple Reynolds
numbers, with the near-wake at only one, for comparing to the RVAT baseline
data.
