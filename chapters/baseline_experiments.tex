\chapter{Experimental characterization of high and low solidity cross-flow turbines}

The first objective was to acquire high-fidelity experimental data to get a
clear picture of what it is we were trying to predict. We were looking to
acquire both performance data (mechanical power, drag force) and velocity data
in the near-wake. To do this, it was necessary to upgrade the UNH tow tank's
linear motion, control, and data acquisition systems, along with the turbine
test bed instrumentation developed in \cite{Bachant2011MS}.
